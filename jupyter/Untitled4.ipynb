      "THE Federal Government may have turned the over N1tn Natural Minerals Resources Fund set up to develop the solid minerals sector to a ‘slush’ fund, investigations by Sunday PUNCH have revealed.\n",
      "The fund was set up by the Olusegun Obasanjo administration via an Executive Order in 2002 to develop alternative mineral resources to lessen the nation’s dependence on petroleum in the country.\n",
      "Findings indicated that N738.7bn and $3m had been disbursed from the fund for extraneous expenses, including the 2015 elections, African Nations Cup, roads and drainage rehabilitation in Osun, Kano and other states.\n",
      "Total accrual to the fund between 2002 and 2012 was put at N873bn, while utilisation stood at N701bn, leaving a balance of N172bn by the end of 2012. \n",
      "Between 2013 and 2014, N159.6bn was contributed to the fund, leaving an outstanding balance of N350bn.\n",

      "It said Osinbajo approved disbursement from the fund while he was acting President contrary to the stipulations by the Revenue Mobilisation Allocation and Fiscal Policy.\n",
      "About N100m was also approved for the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development for control of locust and other outbreaks in Niger Republic in September 2016.\n",

      "The Nigerian Communications Commission has warned members of the public that a cybercrime group has perfected a New Year scheme to deliver ransomware to targeted organisational networks.\n",
      "The NCC said the new ransomware uncovered by security experts has been categorised, by the Nigerian Computer Emergency Response Team’s (ngCERT) advisory released over the weekend, as high-risk and critical.\n",
      "NCC Director, Public Affairs, Dr. Ikechukwu Adinde, disclosed this in a statement on Saturday.\n",
      "“According to the ngCERT advisory, the criminal group is said to have been mailing out USB thumb drives to many organisations in the hope that recipients will plug them into their PCs and install the ransomware on their networks. While businesses are being targeted, criminals could soon begin sending infected USB drives to individuals. \n",
      "“Describing how the cybercrime group runs the ransomeware, the ngCERT advisory says the USB drives contain so-called ‘BadUSB’ attacks. The BadUSB exploits the USB standards versatility and allows an attacker to reprogram a USB drive to emulate a keyboard to create keystrokes and commands on a computer. It then installs malware prior to the operating system booting, or spoofs a network card to redirect traffic.\n",
      "“Numerous attack tools are also installed in the process that allows for exploitation of personal computers (PCs), lateral movement across a network, and installation of additional malware. The tools were used to deploy multiple ransomware strains, including BlackBatter and REvil.\n",
      "“According to ngCERT, the attack has been seen in the US where the USB drives were sent in the mail through the Postal Service and Parcel Service. One type contained a message impersonating the US Department of Health and Human Services and claimed to be a COVID-19 warning. Other malicious USBs were sent in the post with a gift card claiming to be from Amazon.\n",

      "“However, ngCERT has offered recommendations that will enable corporate and individual networks to mitigate the impact of this new cyber attack and be protected from the ransomware.\n",
      "“These recommendations include a call on individuals and organisations not to insert USB drives from unknown sources, even if they’re addressed to you or your organization. In addition, if the USB drive comes from a company or a person one is not familiar with and trusts, it is recommended that one contacts the source to confirm they actually sent the USB drive.\n",
      "“Finally, ngCERT has advised Information and Communication Technology as well as other Internet users to report any incident of system compromises to ngCERT via [email protected], for technical assistance,” the statement read in part.\n",

      "An elder and former governor of Anambra State, Chief Chukwuemeka Ezeife, has expressed disappointment over the position of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), that the leader of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra, Nnamdi Kanu, will not be released from detention.\n",
      "Kanu was arrested last year in Kenya and brought back to Nigeria before he was charged with offences bordering on treasonable felony and terrorism.\n",
      "President Buhari had told Igbo elders led by the First Republic parliamentarian and Minister of Aviation, Mbazulike Amaechi, who visited him at the State House, Abuja, that though their request for Kanu’s release was heavy, he (Buhari) would consider it.\n",
      "The President was, however, categorical in an interview with Channels Television when he said he would not release Kanu and that the IPOB leader should defend himself in court. \n",
      "Speaking in an interview with Saturday PUNCH on Buhari’s latest stand on the matter, Ezeife said he and his friends were bound to be disappointed, saying the President, by his recent position, rubbished all that happened during the Igbo elders’ visit to the State House in Abuja.\n",
      "The former governor said, “There is nothing we can do. After the meeting, the people who are familiar with him said he responded to us truthfully and that he took our case very seriously and that his answer gives hope.\n",
      "“We went away with that, that there is hope. But for him now to, in public, rubbish all that happened, I am bound to be disappointed and so would be my friends who were there.”\n",

If he can assemble maybe five people per zone and let them look at all the reports, including 2014, all the constitutions we have had, the 1963 Constitution and all that, and work out an agreement with all the groups for a Nigeria with political rearrangement that would satisfy other people.\n",
      "“I don’t want to just say I am very disappointed because I am very much interested in Nigeria surviving. So, I suggest this caucus of knowledgeable people who can work out a new arrangement politically for Nigeria. The political solution is the only one that can solve the problem.\n",
      "Buhari’ll not renege on promise, says Amaechi\n",
      "However, in a separate interview with Amaechi, the leader of the Igbo elders’ delegation to Aso Rock, he expressed optimism that the President would not renege on his promise to consider a political solution to Kanu’s matter.\n",
      "Amaechi said, “Kanu’s situation can be solved either politically or even legally. It can be solved legally by the Attorney General. When I met the President, he told me he would consider my request on Nnamdi Kanu.\n",
      "“There are many ways to kill a rat. So, I have no reason to doubt the President. People need to trust him because he is not the type of President who talks without knowing what he is saying. He is a highly principled man.\n",

      "It was gathered that the peaceful protests were staged in Oka Akoko, Akungba Akoko and some other Akoko towns.\n",
      "The protests were said to have been triggered by the recent kidnap of teachers by some terrorists in Auga Akoko, killing of a police officer by gunmen at Oka Akoko last week and the attack of 17 travellers on Ifira Akoko-Isua Akoko Road by armed robbers, among others.\n",
      "Some of the protesters, who were holding brooms in their hands, were half naked, chanting various solidarity songs along the streets. \n",

      "Speaking during the 2022 Armed Forces Remembrance Day Ceremony in Port Harcourt on Saturday, Wike said Nigeria was at the crossroads and everyone was weary about the prolonged Boko Haram insurgency in parts of the country.\n",
      "This was contained in a statement by the Special Assistant to the Governor on Media, Kevin Ebiri, and made available to journalists.\n",
      "“However, the generality of Nigerians believe that the progress made can’t be good enough insofar as Boko Haram and its affiliates are still active in the North-East, North-West and some other parts of the country, killing, maiming and kidnapping helpless people, including school children, and destroying and displacing hapless communities. \n",
      "“We, therefore, call on Mr President to redouble his efforts and fulfil his cardinal electoral promise to secure the country and ensure that Nigerians feel safe and remain safe and secure wherever they are in their own country,” he stated.\n",

There are a lot of lies that are flying around.”\n",
      "But on Saturday, the chairman-elect of the APC loyal to the governor in the state, Prince ‘Gboyega Famoodun, described members loyal to the Aregbesola group as disgruntled members of the party.\n",
      "Famoodun in a statement in Osogbo on Saturday, berated Aregbesola for open declaration of support for TOP, saying the conduct of the ex-governor was below expectation. He also told Aregbesola to perish the belief that he was the only powerbroker in Osun progressive politics. He said the former governor was only living in past glory.\n",
      "The statement read in part, “The intra-APC opposition group, called TOP, which meets every Thursday in the Campaign Office of the Interior Minister in Osogbo has become a venue where barrage of insults are heaped on the person of Governor Gboyega Oyetola, the state leadership of the APC and the state government by the leadership of the said TOP.\n",

      "“Osun APC is too strong for Aregbesola to break. His recent statement in Ilesa reduces his status as a former governor and as a serving minister of a party he claimed to belong to. Aregbesola is an arrogant, selfish, self-centered, reckless, wicked and inconsiderate politician who wants the whole world to be his possession. It is not an overstatement to categorise Aregbesola as someone who prefers to rule in hell than to serve in paradise.\n",
      "“Aregbesola should be told that there is no amount of intrigues by him that is capable of bungling the second term ambition of Governor Oyetola as it has divine guidance and pathfinder which makes him(the governor) unstoppable by any mortal.”\n",
      "When contacted for reaction, secretary of Aregbesola backed APC faction, Lani Baderinwa, said response to Famoodun “will be made available soonest.”\n",
      "Only genuine resolution can bring peace to Osun APC – Aregbesola’s group\n",
      "Meanwhile, Baderinwa had told one of our correspondents that only reorganisation and genuine reconciliation could return peace to the party. Baderinwa,  expressed hope that the reconciliation committee, having heard the complaints of the group, would ensure that justice was served.\n",
      "“We have met with the reconciliation committee and all we have been saying is that let us ensure reorganisation and fairness. We hope justice will be served by the committee. Until then, the party will continue to push for a better APC that can win elections without struggling in Osun State,” Baderinwa added.\n",

However, while we appreciate the intervention of the committee in finding lasting solutions to the lingering crises in the Kwara APC, we noticed the unpleasant body language and conduct of the chairman were at variance with the stated objectives of the committee.\n",

I have called the secretary to tell him that we will all have our day in court. Not that we were surprised though, we knew the reconciliation committee was not really good and they were not reconciling anything other than their pockets.\n",

However, there was never a time that there was contemplation for a repeat of congresses in Gombe State on the basis that (former Governor Danjuma) Goje made a request.

      "A top official of one of the factions who does not want his name mentioned because he was not permitted to speak on the matter said despite the committee’s effort to ensure peace reigned, the feud in the party had continued unabated.\n",
      "It was gathered that the reconciliation committee members were in Kano about two months ago, but failed to reach a compromise as a result of the pending appeal in court. As of the time of filing this report, the factions also refused to speak on the matter because the matter was subjudice.\n",

      "Akeredolu, who stated this at the final parade and laying of a wreath held at the government cenotaph, Alagbaka, Akure, said, “It would amount to doing them the greatest injustice, just to praise them with words alone, but valuable, when it is backed up with our supports, financially and materially to the legionnaires for the well-being of the widows and dependants of these patriotic Heroes.\n",

      "He said, “the brave warriors we are honouring today, believed in something, an ideal or causes higher than their personal or collective interest, and that’s why they elected through volunteerism, not by conscription to sign up to fight for the preservation of our territorial integrity against foreign or domestic enemies.\n",
      "“As we get ready to elect our next set of leaders, let us be reminded that national interest should and must triumph over our personal or group interest. Let me use this opportunity to appeal to our people to eschew tendencies that help provide the ferment for conflicts.”\n",

      "There are concerns over increased proliferation and illegal possession of firearms across Nigeria amid delay in the passage of the bills seeking to address the problem and the attendant violent crimes.\n",
      "The National Assembly is currently considering over five bills, some of which came from the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), seeking to address illegal arms proliferation.\n",
      "There have been deep concerns over the influx of firearms across the country attributed to the country’s porous borders and corruption by the agencies manning them. Worried by the trend, the President recently said only God could “effectively supervise” Nigeria’s 1,400km border with Niger Republic.\n",
      "In mid-December 2020, the Nigeria Customs Service intercepted a container loaded with firearms and ammunition at the Tin Can port in Lagos without any immediate reasonable explanation from those conveying them. \n",
      "Barely one week later, the police said at least 1,889 weapons and 52,577 rounds of live ammunition were recovered between January and December 2021. The spokesperson for the Nigeria Police Force, CP Frank Mba, told The PUNCH that the recovered weapons include General Purpose Machine Guns, Rocket-Propelled Grenade, variants of Avtomat Kalashnikov, with the popular ones being AK-47 and AK-49, and some locally-fabricated weapons.\n",
      "He noted that some of the arms in circulation were produced in illegal arms manufacturing factories operating in the country, noting however that the police would continue to bring the perpetrators to book.\n",
      "Beyond the recent seizures, in January 2017, 661 pump-action rifles already cleared at the Lagos port were later intercepted by the NCS. Another 440 assorted firearms were seized at the same port in May of that year, and 470 pump-action rifles were also seized just four months after. Meanwhile, a 2016 United Nations’ report said Nigeria accounted for 350 million out of the 500 million illegal arms in West Africa.\n",

      "Among several other deadly incidents, Saturday PUNCH reported on December 18 that no fewer than 849 persons were killed by bandits within the past five months in Zamfara, Kaduna, Sokoto and Katsina states.\n",
      "Despite the increasing level of insecurity across the country, the lawmakers have failed to accelerate work on the firearms bills aimed at tackling the proliferation and crimes.\n",

      "Ekweremadu, in an interview with our correspondent, stated that while he had always advocated for the establishment of policing systems at the state level, arming people to protect lives and property without government regulation portends danger for the polity.\n",
      "He said, “Under the Firearms Act, only the President can permit you to carry arms and he also determines what level of arms that you can carry, otherwise carrying arms by anybody is completely forbidden. But now, you see people carry arms and sometimes they abuse the use of these arms; sometimes they go and fire at people who are assembling freely. So, these are some of the fears that people are having, and this can get worse.\n",
      "“But my answer to this is that you cannot talk about decentralised policing without a regulation; it has to be regulated. Today, we have a state judiciary, and the judiciary has the power of life and death but it has not been abused simply because it is being regulated under the Constitution. So, if we are going to police this country effectively, we must have decentralised police that is regulated. That is the caveat.”\n",

      "A retired Commissioner of Police, Emmanuel Ojukwu, said the police must be accountable to Nigerians by ensuring a proper return on the alleged missing weapons.\n",
      "He stated, “My take is that such a report is scandalous, it is embarrassing. It is expected in a democracy that the police should account annually, regularly to the people. What the auditor-general has done is in line with his duty; it is to raise a query, which is a question to the police to account for the guns.\n",
      "‘’In that report, they said the procedure was not followed, returns were not properly rendered, there were gaps here and there. It does not mean that those weapons are missing; all it means is that the police did not do what they ought to do or they have not done what they ought to do.’’\n",
      "A security analyst, Ben Okezie, stated that the police authorities should not keep mum on the revelations by the AuGF.\n",
      "He said, ‘’I don’t think it is good for the police not to address this allegation; they have to confirm or deny the report. The Auditor-General cannot just wake up and pass this kind of judgment on the police. It is an indictment on the police leadership. If the IG (Inspector-General of Police) does not say something before the weekend, it means something is amiss.’’\n",
      "Okezie recalled that former President Olusegun Obasanjo once raised the alarm about the influx of suspected armed robbers and cultists into the police, noting that the force leadership failed to flush out the miscreants – many of who he said later dominated the defunct Special Anti-Robbery Squad.\n",
      "He said, “The auditor-general report is an indictment but it needs to be re-investigated so we don’t give a dog a bad name in order to hang it. The police need to carry out internal auditing of their men. We have to decentralise the police; state police would address this issue.’’\n",

      "Describing the firearms as a trust given to the police, the former force spokesman urged the police authorities to clear the doubts on the missing arms as raised by the AuGF.\n",
      "But the Commissioner representing the media in the Police Service Commission, Austin Braimoh, said it would be wrong to assume that the missing weapons were all stolen, arguing that the report failed to disclose the circumstances behind the reported loss.\n",
      "He added, ‘’During EndSARS protests, we lost so many police stations where arms and ammunition were burnt down and many stations were looted. I don’t think it would be right to blame the police for that.\n",
      "‘’We have to be careful; that’s why you cannot treat that report the way it is. The loss should be clarified and the circumstances of the loss before you can say someone should be punished. The police did not lose the firearms carelessly. There are few isolated cases of people responsible for losses and they were duly punished and the records are before us.\n",
      "‘’Loss of firearms by officers during operations attracts punishment, including dismissal or reduction in rank. But when you talk of these massive losses, most of them are the result of attacks by bandits or during the protests. The audit report may seem to have indicted the police but it is not exactly so. Many arms have been lost but it is not the fault of the police.”    ,,\n",

      "Former Senate President, Bukola Saraki, has urged the Federal Government to revisit recommendations of the various security summits and harmonise them in order to quickly end the security crisis across the country.\n",
      "Saraki also commended the courage and patriotism of the members of the security agencies fighting against enemies of the country and sought improved welfare for ex-servicemen and their families as the nation marked the 2022 Armed Forces Remembrance Day on Saturday.\n",
      "The former Kwara State governor in a statement on Saturday by his spokesperson, Yusuf Olaniyonu, said the next government must revisit all the security reports, noting that the implementation of the recommendations required strong political will and transparency to ensure success.\n",
      "He said, “Throughout Nigeria today, we commemorate the courage and sacrifice of our veterans — men and women from all across the country who have sacrificed their lives, their time, and blood and sweat for the nation. As we remember our armed forces (personnel) who have and continue to sacrifice, we must also remember to pay our respects to the families of our veterans and servicemen and thank them assiduously for their service. \n",
      "“We already have enough recommendations from the various summits, dialogues, and special sessions on security organised by the executive, legislature, non-governmental organisations, and development partners. All a new government should do is harness the recommendations and demonstrate the strong will, determination, and urgency in translating them into operation.”\n",
      "Saraki equally demanded transparency and accountability in the application of funds devoted to security across the board, noting that new strategies that will put technology at the forefront of security arrangement must be prioritised.\n",
      "He added, “We must be able to adopt modern-day strategies that will help in intelligence gathering; plugging the financial loopholes that these terrorists and bandits exploit, and stop playing lip service to the issue of security.\n",

      "The World Health Organisation has recommended two new drugs for COVID-19, providing yet more options for treating the disease.\n",
      "The WHO, in a statement on its website, said the extent to which these medicines would save lives depends on how widely available and affordable they would be.\n",
      "The statement partly reads in part, “The first drug, baricitinib, is strongly recommended for patients with severe or critical COVID-19. It is part of a class of drugs called Janus kinase inhibitors that suppress the overstimulation of the immune system. WHO recommends that it is given with corticosteroids.\n",
      "“Baricitinib is an oral drug, used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. It provides an alternative to other arthritis drugs called Interleukin-6 receptor blockers, recommended by WHO in July 2021.” \n",
      "WHO also conditionally recommended the use of a monoclonal antibody drug, sotrovimab, for treating mild or moderate COVID-19 in patients who are at high risk of hospitalisation.\n",
      "“This includes patients who are older, immunocompromised, having underlying conditions like diabetes, hypertension, and obesity, and those unvaccinated.\n",
      "“Sotrovimab is an alternative to casirivimab-imdevimab, a monoclonal antibody cocktail recommended by WHO in September 2021. Studies are ongoing on the effectiveness of monoclonal antibodies against Omicron but early laboratory studies show that sotrovimab retains its activity,” the statement added.\n",

      "The Nigerian Communications Commission has warned members of the public that a cybercrime group has perfected a New Year scheme to deliver ransomware to targeted organisational networks.\n",
      "The NCC said the new ransomware uncovered by security experts has been categorised, by the Nigerian Computer Emergency Response Team’s (ngCERT) advisory released over the weekend, as high-risk and critical.\n",
      "NCC Director, Public Affairs, Dr. Ikechukwu Adinde, disclosed this in a statement on Saturday.\n",
      "“According to the ngCERT advisory, the criminal group is said to have been mailing out USB thumb drives to many organisations in the hope that recipients will plug them into their PCs and install the ransomware on their networks. While businesses are being targeted, criminals could soon begin sending infected USB drives to individuals. \n",
      "“Describing how the cybercrime group runs the ransomeware, the ngCERT advisory says the USB drives contain so-called ‘BadUSB’ attacks. The BadUSB exploits the USB standards versatility and allows an attacker to reprogram a USB drive to emulate a keyboard to create keystrokes and commands on a computer. It then installs malware prior to the operating system booting, or spoofs a network card to redirect traffic.\n",
      "“Numerous attack tools are also installed in the process that allows for exploitation of personal computers (PCs), lateral movement across a network, and installation of additional malware. The tools were used to deploy multiple ransomware strains, including BlackBatter and REvil.\n",
      "“According to ngCERT, the attack has been seen in the US where the USB drives were sent in the mail through the Postal Service and Parcel Service. One type contained a message impersonating the US Department of Health and Human Services and claimed to be a COVID-19 warning. Other malicious USBs were sent in the post with a gift card claiming to be from Amazon.\n",

      "“However, ngCERT has offered recommendations that will enable corporate and individual networks to mitigate the impact of this new cyber attack and be protected from the ransomware.\n",
      "“These recommendations include a call on individuals and organisations not to insert USB drives from unknown sources, even if they’re addressed to you or your organization. In addition, if the USB drive comes from a company or a person one is not familiar with and trusts, it is recommended that one contacts the source to confirm they actually sent the USB drive.\n",
      "“Finally, ngCERT has advised Information and Communication Technology as well as other Internet users to report any incident of system compromises to ngCERT via [email protected], for technical assistance,” the statement read in part.\n",

      "An elder and former governor of Anambra State, Chief Chukwuemeka Ezeife, has expressed disappointment over the position of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), that the leader of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra, Nnamdi Kanu, will not be released from detention.\n",
      "Kanu was arrested last year in Kenya and brought back to Nigeria before he was charged with offences bordering on treasonable felony and terrorism.\n",

      "Speaking in an interview with Saturday PUNCH on Buhari’s latest stand on the matter, Ezeife said he and his friends were bound to be disappointed, saying the President, by his recent position, rubbished all that happened during the Igbo elders’ visit to the State House in Abuja.\n",
      "The former governor said, “There is nothing we can do. After the meeting, the people who are familiar with him said he responded to us truthfully and that he took our case very seriously and that his answer gives hope.\n",

If he can assemble maybe five people per zone and let them look at all the reports, including 2014, all the constitutions we have had, the 1963 Constitution and all that, and work out an agreement with all the groups for a Nigeria with political rearrangement that would satisfy other people.\n",

      "Amaechi said, “Kanu’s situation can be solved either politically or even legally. It can be solved legally by the Attorney General. When I met the President, he told me he would consider my request on Nnamdi Kanu.\n",

I don’t know if you live in Kaduna or not but if you came from somewhere, you must have looked across your shoulders, maybe, more than 20 times because to leave your house and get back home is a miracle these days in this country. We were not like this.\n",
      "“This is not the Nigeria that voted for President Buhari. So, he is a disappointment. And that’s why we are saying to Nigerians and particularly to northerners to be very careful and not repeat the same mistake.”\n",

      "Efforts by the National Reconciliation Committee set up by the leadership of the All Progressives Congress to resolve the internal crisis in some state chapters of the party may have suffered a setback in some states, Sunday PUNCH has learnt.\n",
      "In some of the states visited by the committee, led by a former governor of Nasarawa State, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, findings showed that the crisis in the party was far from over.\n",
      "It is believed that the prolonged crisis in the state chapters of the party prevented the party from holding its national convention. Since June 2020 when the committee, led by Governor Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State, was inaugurated, the convention has been postponed several times.\n",
      "At the ward, local government and state congresses of the party held previously, parallel leadership emerged in many states, prompting the setting up of the committee. \n",
      "Oyetola and Aregbesola groups fight on in Osun\n",
      "Meanwhile, barely one week after the Adamu-led committee visited Osun State to reconcile aggrieved party members, peace has yet to return to the state chapter of the party. Governor Adegboyega Oyetola and his predecessor, Mr Rauf Aregbesola, have remained at loggerheads.\n",
      "Aregbesola, who is also the Minister of Interior, said on Friday that the ruling party in the state was divided, noting that at the right time, the party would be reorganised.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking during the inauguration of the Digital Nigeria Centre in Ijesa Muslim Grammar School, Ilesa, Aregbesola alluded to the existence of The Osun Progressives loyal to him, and another group, Ileri Oluwa, loyal to the governor.\n",
      "Speaking in Yoruba, Aregbesola, acknowledged Rasaq Salinsile, who his faction elected as the chairman of the APC in the state.\n",
      "The former governor said, “For anybody who seeks to know, the APC is divided in Osun. We have APC of Rauf Aregbesola, which is chaired by Mr Razaq Salinsile, and the other. Everybody is doing his or her own, later, we will reorganise, we will rearrange everything.\n",
      "“The caucus that produced our faction is called The Osun Progressives chaired by Elder Lowo Adebiyi. People who are in doubt, thinking whether I am part of the TOP or not should listen, I belong to TOP. I am happy that the Commissioner of Police is here. There are a lot of lies that are flying around.”\n",
      "But on Saturday, the chairman-elect of the APC loyal to the governor in the state, Prince ‘Gboyega Famoodun, described members loyal to the Aregbesola group as disgruntled members of the party.\n",
      "Famoodun in a statement in Osogbo on Saturday, berated Aregbesola for open declaration of support for TOP, saying the conduct of the ex-governor was below expectation. He also told Aregbesola to perish the belief that he was the only powerbroker in Osun progressive politics. He said the former governor was only living in past glory.\n",
      "The statement read in part, “The intra-APC opposition group, called TOP, which meets every Thursday in the Campaign Office of the Interior Minister in Osogbo has become a venue where barrage of insults are heaped on the person of Governor Gboyega Oyetola, the state leadership of the APC and the state government by the leadership of the said TOP.\n",

      "“This disgruntled set of the APC members are peopled by members of the cabinet of Aregbesola during his two terms as the governor of the state who are now protesting their not being appointed by Governor Oyetola for the third term.\n",
      "“Osun APC is too strong for Aregbesola to break. His recent statement in Ilesa reduces his status as a former governor and as a serving minister of a party he claimed to belong to. Aregbesola is an arrogant, selfish, self-centered, reckless, wicked and inconsiderate politician who wants the whole world to be his possession. It is not an overstatement to categorise Aregbesola as someone who prefers to rule in hell than to serve in paradise.\n",
      "“Aregbesola should be told that there is no amount of intrigues by him that is capable of bungling the second term ambition of Governor Oyetola as it has divine guidance and pathfinder which makes him(the governor) unstoppable by any mortal.”\n",
      "When contacted for reaction, secretary of Aregbesola backed APC faction, Lani Baderinwa, said response to Famoodun “will be made available soonest.”\n",
      "Only genuine resolution can bring peace to Osun APC – Aregbesola’s group\n",
      "Meanwhile, Baderinwa had told one of our correspondents that only reorganisation and genuine reconciliation could return peace to the party. Baderinwa,  expressed hope that the reconciliation committee, having heard the complaints of the group, would ensure that justice was served.\n",
      "“We have met with the reconciliation committee and all we have been saying is that let us ensure reorganisation and fairness. We hope justice will be served by the committee. Until then, the party will continue to push for a better APC that can win elections without struggling in Osun State,” Baderinwa added.\n",
      "Meanwhile, the verbal attacks between Aregbesola’s camp and the faction loyal to the governor in the past few days were a testament to the raging impasse between the two camps.\n",

      "Adamu had assured the factions of fair hearing and that it would try its best to reconcile the parties.\n",
      "The Publicity Secretary of the faction loyal to the governor, Alhaji Folaranmi Aro, who confirmed that the committee met the group, said the prominent members of the opposing group in the party including the two ministers; Lai Mohammed and Ms Gbemisola Saraki, as well as Bashir Bolarinwa, the suspended chairman of the APC Caretaker Committee in the state, were not present at the meeting.\n",
      "Meanwhile, soon after the committee left the state, the faction loyal to the Information and Culture minister accused the chairman of the reconciliation committee of bias, saying he should do justice to the issues without fear or favour in the overall interest of the party.\n",
      "In a statement jointly signed by the state secretary of the faction, Alhaji Isiaka Agboji, and the publicity secretary, Mr Ibrahim Sharafdeen, the faction said Adamu’s body language and conduct were at variance with the stated objectives of the committee.\n",
      "They said Adamu’s comment that he would not accept anything that could discredit the administration of the APC-led administration in the state was a “prejudicial remark from a man expected to be neutral in view of the volatile nature of his assignment.”\n",
      "Their statement added, “We view such a belligerent tone as a prelude to what should be expected as the outcome of his input to the committee’s report. It is our belief that anyone who uses reason to escape history will end up repeating history.\n",

      "“Needless to say that prior to the arrival of the committee in the state on January 10, 2022, the parties had been requested to make their presentations in writing which was done. However, while we appreciate the intervention of the committee in finding lasting solutions to the lingering crises in the Kwara APC, we noticed the unpleasant body language and conduct of the chairman were at variance with the stated objectives of the committee.\n",
      "“Further, even if the Committee Chairman has a long-standing relationship with the patriarch of Abdulrahman Abdulrasaq’s family, we consider it indecent to use the venue of the meeting to express such sentimental attachment.”\n",
      "The statement described the committee members as persons of impeccable character and that the faction would not impugn their integrity in any way. However, they said, “Having done what is expected of us by articulating our position on the matter at hand and proffering what we consider as way forward to the committee, we hope the leadership of the party at the national level will do justice without fear or favour in the overall interest of the party.”\n",
      "Mohammed’s group lists demands\n",
      "In a related development, the deputy chairman of Lai Mohammed faction, Chief Sunday Oyebiyi, who led members to meet the committee, told Sunday PUNCH that they were still expecting to hear from the committee. He told one of our correspondents the requests presented by their faction before the committee.\n",
      "He said, “Our requests: we urge this committee to ensure immediate registration of our members who are in the majority but were prevented from participating in the last party registration and revalidation exercise in the state. We also want our members to be included in every arrangement of the registration process by the national body.\n",

      "In Lagos State, the party’s spokesperson, Mr Seye Oladejo, told one of our correspondents in an interview on Thursday that the party was at peace as a result of the intervention of the National Caretaker Committee from Abuja.\n",
      "Oladejo said, “Reconciliation in any political party remains work in progress. The internal mechanism of the party for crisis management is always the most active organ of the party. The only aggrieved party to the best of my knowledge expectedly defected true to their script. The party is at peace.”\n",
      "A faction of the party, called the APC Democrats, however, faulted the reconciliation committee, saying their intervention was selfish and insincere, adding that they would meet in court.\n",
      "The chairman of the group, Mr Fouad Oki, in a telephone interview with one of our correspondents, said, “First of all, the reconciliation committee did not inform anybody of its coming to Lagos. No information whatsoever. Secondly, they came to see Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, as far as we are concerned, because it (meeting) was held at the governor’s house.\n",
      "“Thirdly, they told a lie that there were no memoranda from Lagos. That is far from the truth. At the appropriate time, we will take them up. I have called the secretary to tell him that we will all have our day in court. Not that we were surprised though, we knew the reconciliation committee was not really good and they were not reconciling anything other than their pockets.\n",
      "“As far as our party in Lagos is concerned, there was no reconciliation. In fact, in our records, they never came to Lagos. I am sure even selected media outlets were allowed to cover it. That is enough for the intervention to be questioned.”\n",

      "However, the chairman of the faction loyal to Amosun, Chief Derin Adebiyi, said he was optimistic there would be reconciliation. “Definitely, I am optimistic that there will be unification in the party.\n",
      "When asked about the outcome of the meetings with the factions, Adebiyi declined comment, saying he would not disclose the demands and conditions given. “I prefer to keep it in the interest of unification of the party,” he added.\n",
      "Attempts to get the reaction from the faction loyal to the governor failed as neither the factional chairman, Yemi Sanusi, nor the publicity secretary, Tunde Oladunjoye, answered several calls made to their mobile lines.\n",
      "In Gombe State, the Publicity Secretary, Moses Kyari, said the recently held reconciliation had helped to douse disaffection within its rank. In an interview with one of our correspondents, he debunked insinuations that there would be a repeat of congresses in the state.\n",
      "He said, “Reconciliation has taken place. However, there was never a time that there was contemplation for a repeat of congresses in Gombe State on the basis that (former Governor Danjuma) Goje made a request. It is not true and it has been addressed by the Press Secretary to Governor Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State that there was nothing like that.”\n",

      "A top official of one of the factions who does not want his name mentioned because he was not permitted to speak on the matter said despite the committee’s effort to ensure peace reigned, the feud in the party had continued unabated.\n",
      "It was gathered that the reconciliation committee members were in Kano about two months ago, but failed to reach a compromise as a result of the pending appeal in court. As of the time of filing this report, the factions also refused to speak on the matter because the matter was subjudice.\n",

      "The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo, Senate President Ahmad Lawan; Speaker, House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila; and state governors were among those who laid wreaths at the 2022 Armed Forces Remembrance Day in honour of the Nigerian military personnel who died in the line of duty.\n",
      "The President on Saturday presided over the historic event at the National Arcade in Abuja, inspecting a Guard of Honour mounted by detachments of the Nigerian Army, the Navy, the Air Force and the Nigerian Legion.\n",
      "Buhari laid a wreath on the tomb of the unknown soldier as a mark of last respect to the fallen heroes who paid the supreme price to preserve the nation’s territorial integrity and peace globally.\n",
      "Three volleys of 21 gun salute were fired at the event followed by the signing of the Remembrance Day Anniversary register by the President who thereafter, released white pigeons to indicate the harmony of the nation. \n",
      "Also, state governors paid tributes to the fallen heroes, solicited support for their families and sued for peace and unity across the country.\n",
      "The Ondo State Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu urged all stakeholders to support the widows and dependants of personnel who died in the course of defending the country.\n",
      "Akeredolu, who stated this at the final parade and laying of a wreath held at the government cenotaph, Alagbaka, Akure, said, “It would amount to doing them the greatest injustice, just to praise them with words alone, but valuable, when it is backed up with our supports, financially and materially to the legionnaires for the well-being of the widows and dependants of these patriotic Heroes.\n",

      "While praising the late heroes, the Bayelsa State Governor, Douye Diri, called on politicians to avoid actions that would lead to bloodletting in the 2023 elections.\n",
      "The governor in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Daniel Alabrah, added, “Let us continue to show love to our heroes and their loved ones by supporting the various projects and interventions that have been set up to care for our men and women in uniform.”\n",
      "In his remarks, the Anambra State Governor, Willie Obiano, hailed the Nigerian Armed Forces for the sacrifices they made in ensuring that citizens live a better life in the country.\n",
      "The governor also expressed gratitude to the ex-service men and women living with different forms of disabilities as a result of conflict and war.\n",
      "He said, “As we lay wreaths and release pigeons in their memory today, we pray for their peaceful repose in the bosom of Almighty God. We pray that the peace of God that surpasses all understanding should descend on Nigeria.”\n",

Therefore, as a people, let us seize this day to recommit ourselves to the ideals of nationhood that are reflective of the vision of our forefathers, by taking responsibility to create a society that works for all.\n",
      "“While thanking members of the armed forces for their immeasurable contributions to nation building, I, on behalf of our people, charge them to give more for our nation, knowing that no true and genuine service to humanity shall go unrewarded.”\n",
      "In the same vein, the Akwa Ibom State Governor, Udom Emmanuel, charged politicians to eschew tendencies capable of heating up the polity or straining the cords of unity, as the nation approaches electioneering season.\n",
      "He said, “the brave warriors we are honouring today, believed in something, an ideal or causes higher than their personal or collective interest, and that’s why they elected through volunteerism, not by conscription to sign up to fight for the preservation of our territorial integrity against foreign or domestic enemies.\n",
      "“As we get ready to elect our next set of leaders, let us be reminded that national interest should and must triumph over our personal or group interest. Let me use this opportunity to appeal to our people to eschew tendencies that help provide the ferment for conflicts.”\n",
      "The governor said besides the building of 168 blocks of flats for the officers and men of the Nigerian Army Battalion located in Ibagwa and water reticulation to provide potable water for residents of the barracks, his government had redeemed the promise of N100m grant to the widows of the fallen heroes in the state.\n",

We salute all of them, including those of them who had lost their lives in the course of serving the nation.”\n",

      "Obaseki stated, “People must understand that such careless talks caused the loss of lives and we should not lead ourselves where history will repeat itself in this country. As a government, we will continue to look out and take care of the families of those who have lost their lives. The ex-servicemen are well integrated into our security infrastructure in the state where they supervise certain groups and vigilantes in the state.\n",

      "He said, “Soldiers lose life and limb in the course of serving their country. Nigeria owes them a debt of eternal gratitude for their immeasurable sacrifices.\n",
      "“It is embarrassing why our veterans should be allowed to be sleeping in the open to protest the nonpayment of their pensions.”\n",
      "He also advised the government to streamline the payment system of “our veterans to avoid the humiliation of recourse to protest the non-payment of their entitlements.”\n",

      "The state, Governor Aminu Masari, who was the guest of honour at the event, assured that the government would not relent in its efforts at ensuring security of lives and property in the state.\n",

      "“The relative peace experienced now in this state is largely attributed to the dedication, professional competence and discipline of our brothers and sisters serving in the military and other sister security agencies. The relationship between the military and the host community has remained cordial and l urge you to maintain this laudable standard.”\n",

      "There are concerns over increased proliferation and illegal possession of firearms across Nigeria amid delay in the passage of the bills seeking to address the problem and the attendant violent crimes.\n",
      "The National Assembly is currently considering over five bills, some of which came from the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), seeking to address illegal arms proliferation.\n",
      "There have been deep concerns over the influx of firearms across the country attributed to the country’s porous borders and corruption by the agencies manning them. Worried by the trend, the President recently said only God could “effectively supervise” Nigeria’s 1,400km border with Niger Republic.\n",
      "In mid-December 2020, the Nigeria Customs Service intercepted a container loaded with firearms and ammunition at the Tin Can port in Lagos without any immediate reasonable explanation from those conveying them. \n",
      "Barely one week later, the police said at least 1,889 weapons and 52,577 rounds of live ammunition were recovered between January and December 2021. The spokesperson for the Nigeria Police Force, CP Frank Mba, told The PUNCH that the recovered weapons include General Purpose Machine Guns, Rocket-Propelled Grenade, variants of Avtomat Kalashnikov, with the popular ones being AK-47 and AK-49, and some locally-fabricated weapons.\n",
      "He noted that some of the arms in circulation were produced in illegal arms manufacturing factories operating in the country, noting however that the police would continue to bring the perpetrators to book.\n",
      "Beyond the recent seizures, in January 2017, 661 pump-action rifles already cleared at the Lagos port were later intercepted by the NCS. Another 440 assorted firearms were seized at the same port in May of that year, and 470 pump-action rifles were also seized just four months after. Meanwhile, a 2016 United Nations’ report said Nigeria accounted for 350 million out of the 500 million illegal arms in West Africa.\n",

      "Among several other deadly incidents, Saturday PUNCH reported on December 18 that no fewer than 849 persons were killed by bandits within the past five months in Zamfara, Kaduna, Sokoto and Katsina states.\n",
      "Despite the increasing level of insecurity across the country, the lawmakers have failed to accelerate work on the firearms bills aimed at tackling the proliferation and crimes.\n",

      "For instance, the Control of Small Arms and Light Weapons Bill, 2021 (SB 794), an executive bill, passed the second reading at the Senate on November 9, 2021, and it was referred to the Committee on National Security and Intelligence.\n",

      "The pressing need for proper regulations on small arms and light weapons was informed by the proliferation and illegal possession of firearms in the country.\n",
      "The Office of the Auditor-General of the Federation recently said that by the end of 2019, the Force Headquarters could not account for 178,459 firearms, out of which 88,078 are AK-47 rifles, according to one of the eight queries issued against the Nigeria Police Force by the office.\n",

      "The office attributed the “anomalies” to “weaknesses in the internal control system at the Nigeria Police Force Armament.”\n",
      "The Auditor-General listed the risks to include “mishandling of firearms/firearms getting to the wrong hands; conversion of firearms to illegal use; and loss of government funds.”\n",
      "How proposed laws seek to check illegal arms, crimes\n",
      "In the Control of Small Arms and Light Weapons Bill, 2021, a series of laws to regulate possession, manufacturing, sale and transfer of firearms have been proposed.\n",
      "The bill proposes to establish a Centre for Coordination and Control of the Proliferation of Small Arms and Light Weapons, which shall create a National Small Arms Registry, while the register will be transmitted to the ECOWAS secretariat in accordance with the provisions of the ECOWAS Convention.\n",
      "Section 5 of the bill reads, “A person shall not have in his possession or under his control any firearm, or ammunition for any firearm, or any component part of such ammunition in the following categories except in accordance with the licence granted by the President acting on the advice of the National Centre: (a) lethal barrelled weapon of any description from which any shot, bullet or other missile can be discharged; (b) muzzle loading firearm of any category; (c) component of any firearm; (d) weapon from which a shot is discharged; or (e) weapon, rifle or pistol from which a projectile can be fired.”\n",
      "Section 23 reads, “(1) Any person in possession of firearms or ammunition without a licence shall on conviction be liable to two years’ imprisonment or a fine of not less than N1,000,000 or both where the person has no previous criminal record.

      "Also, the National Commission Against the Proliferation of Small Arms and Light Weapons (Establishment, Etc.) Bill, 2019 seeks to create a commission that promotes and ensures “coordination of concrete measures for effective control of small arms and light weapons in Nigeria.”\n",

(2) A small arm or light weapon collected under Subsection 1 of this Section shall be registered and securely stored or destroyed.” Read Also Insecurity: Buhari orders increased military campaign in Niger StateSecurity, revenue allocation top agenda as 36 govs meet WednesdayOndo women protest half naked over insecurity \n",

      "He said, “When the executive came up with a similar agency; something very similar to what we have put through public hearing, that caused a bit of delay and we are looking at the possibility of marrying the two.\n",
      "“I want a situation where the (executive) bill will come to the floor; it has gone through the first reading. But ours has gone past public hearing, we were just to submit (the report) and pass it into law. We have really gone far in the process.”\n",
      "Also, Deputy Chairman of the House Committee on National Security and Intelligence, Adejoro Adeogun, corroborated Adeyemi on the condition of the bills.\n",
      "Adeogun said, “The Executive bill has not been referred to the committee; it has only gone through the first reading. It has not gone through the second reading. We have the member bill and ratification of an ECOWAS treaty. We are trying to consolidate all of them; that is what the House is trying to do to avoid conflicts.\n",
      "“Since we have a private member bill and an Executive bill, once we pass one, we cannot revisit the other one; we can only pass amendments to the passed one. So the House is trying to find a way to consolidate all of them. Work is ongoing on them.”\n",

      "Ekweremadu, in an interview with our correspondent, stated that while he had always advocated for the establishment of policing systems at the state level, arming people to protect lives and property without government regulation portends danger for the polity.\n",
      "He said, “Under the Firearms Act, only the President can permit you to carry arms and he also determines what level of arms that you can carry, otherwise carrying arms by anybody is completely forbidden. But now, you see people carry arms and sometimes they abuse the use of these arms; sometimes they go and fire at people who are assembling freely. So, these are some of the fears that people are having, and this can get worse.\n",
      "“But my answer to this is that you cannot talk about decentralised policing without a regulation; it has to be regulated. Today, we have a state judiciary, and the judiciary has the power of life and death but it has not been abused simply because it is being regulated under the Constitution. So, if we are going to police this country effectively, we must have decentralised police that is regulated. That is the caveat.”\n",

      "He stated, “My take is that such a report is scandalous, it is embarrassing. It is expected in a democracy that the police should account annually, regularly to the people. What the auditor-general has done is in line with his duty; it is to raise a query, which is a question to the police to account for the guns.\n",
      "‘’In that report, they said the procedure was not followed, returns were not properly rendered, there were gaps here and there. It does not mean that those weapons are missing; all it means is that the police did not do what they ought to do or they have not done what they ought to do.’’\n",
      "A security analyst, Ben Okezie, stated that the police authorities should not keep mum on the revelations by the AuGF.\n",
      "He said, ‘’I don’t think it is good for the police not to address this allegation; they have to confirm or deny the report. The Auditor-General cannot just wake up and pass this kind of judgment on the police. It is an indictment on the police leadership.

      "But the Commissioner representing the media in the Police Service Commission, Austin Braimoh, said it would be wrong to assume that the missing weapons were all stolen, arguing that the report failed to disclose the circumstances behind the reported loss.\n",
      "He added, ‘’During EndSARS protests, we lost so many police stations where arms and ammunition were burnt down and many stations were looted. I don’t think it would be right to blame the police for that.\n",
      "‘’We have to be careful; that’s why you cannot treat that report the way it is. The loss should be clarified and the circumstances of the loss before you can say someone should be punished. The police did not lose the firearms carelessly. There are few isolated cases of people responsible for losses and they were duly punished and the records are before us.\n",
      "‘’Loss of firearms by officers during operations attracts punishment, including dismissal or reduction in rank. But when you talk of these massive losses, most of them are the result of attacks by bandits or during the protests. The audit report may seem to have indicted the police but it is not exactly so. Many arms have been lost but it is not the fault of the police.”    ,,\n",

While businesses are being targeted, criminals could soon begin sending infected USB drives to individuals. \n",
      "“Describing how the cybercrime group runs the ransomeware, the ngCERT advisory says the USB drives contain so-called ‘BadUSB’ attacks. The BadUSB exploits the USB standards versatility and allows an attacker to reprogram a USB drive to emulate a keyboard to create keystrokes and commands on a computer. It then installs malware prior to the operating system booting, or spoofs a network card to redirect traffic.\n",
      "“Numerous attack tools are also installed in the process that allows for exploitation of personal computers (PCs), lateral movement across a network, and installation of additional malware. The tools were used to deploy multiple ransomware strains, including BlackBatter and REvil.\n",
      "“According to ngCERT, the attack has been seen in the US where the USB drives were sent in the mail through the Postal Service and Parcel Service. One type contained a message impersonating the US Department of Health and Human Services and claimed to be a COVID-19 warning. Other malicious USBs were sent in the post with a gift card claiming to be from Amazon.\n",

      "“These recommendations include a call on individuals and organisations not to insert USB drives from unknown sources, even if they’re addressed to you or your organization.

      "Hundreds of women from four local government areas of Ondo State staged protests on Saturday against the spate of insecurity in the area.\n",
      "It was gathered that the peaceful protests were staged in Oka Akoko, Akungba Akoko and some other Akoko towns.\n",
      "The protests were said to have been triggered by the recent kidnap of teachers by some terrorists in Auga Akoko, killing of a police officer by gunmen at Oka Akoko last week and the attack of 17 travellers on Ifira Akoko-Isua Akoko Road by armed robbers, among others.\n",
      "Some of the protesters, who were holding brooms in their hands, were half naked, chanting various solidarity songs along the streets. \n",
      "They called on the security agents and the state government to come to the rescue of the area from the attack of the bandits.

      "Addressing the protesting women,  the Chairman,  Akoko Divisional Traditional Council of the four local government areas and monarch of Oka Akoko, Oba Yusuf  Adeleye, said the security challenges facing the country, Ondo State and Akokoland would soon become a thing of the past, saying communal and traditional efforts would be applied as parts of solutions to the problems,.\n",
      "The monarch appealed to various communities in Akokoland to “form vigilante groups while local hunters should be encouraged to compliment the efforts of regular security agencies.”\n",

      "Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to redouble efforts in fulfilling his cardinal electoral promise of securing the country.\n",
      "Speaking during the 2022 Armed Forces Remembrance Day Ceremony in Port Harcourt on Saturday, Wike said Nigeria was at the crossroads and everyone was weary about the prolonged Boko Haram insurgency in parts of the country.\n",
      "This was contained in a statement by the Special Assistant to the Governor on Media, Kevin Ebiri, and made available to journalists.\n",
      "“However, the generality of Nigerians believe that the progress made can’t be good enough insofar as Boko Haram and its affiliates are still active in the North-East, North-West and some other parts of the country, killing, maiming and kidnapping helpless people, including school children, and destroying and displacing hapless communities. \n",
      "“We, therefore, call on Mr President to redouble his efforts and fulfil his cardinal electoral promise to secure the country and ensure that Nigerians feel safe and remain safe and secure wherever they are in their own country,” he stated.\n",
      "Wike pointed to the need for the Federal Government to take as top priority the equipping of the nation’s armed forces appropriately.\n",
      "This, he noted, would motivate men and officers of the military to be well poised to accomplish the noble task of securing the country and ensure that Nigerians feel safe within their various communities,” the governor stated.\n",

      "He said, “Nigerians are proud of them for their principled loyalty to the nation, including their capacity and commitment to defend Nigeria’s territorial integrity, democracy and constitutional freedoms of the citizenry.\n",
      "“It is also significant to appreciate that for several families across the nation and communities, today’s remembrance ceremony is a very painful reminder of the loved ones that they lost years, months and even barely weeks ago.’’\n",

      "Northern political elite and groups on Saturday met in Kaduna State with a firm resolve to ignore any provocative statement from the South over the 2023 presidency.\n",
      "They also said northerners possess equal rights like their counterparts from the South to aspire for the presidency in 2023.\n",
      "But they noted that competence, integrity and commitment to the rule of law of such candidate(s) either from North or South, must be a yardstick for support.\n",
      "The Southern and Middle Belt Forum, which comprises the Yoruba socio-political group,  Afenifere; the Igbo socio-political group, Ohanaeze Ndigbo; and the Middle Belt Forum, had urged all parties to zone their presidential ticket to the South ahead of the 2023 presidential election, adding that the South and the Middle Belt would not vote for a northern presidential candidate in 2023. \n",
      "But the northern leaders kicked against it, declaring that the fundamental rights of all political parties to field candidates of their choices, and the right of voters to freely exercise choices over who leads them could not be compromised.\n",
      "Besides, the northern leaders called for the postponement of the planned 2022 national census given the high number of displaced Nigerians as well as the proximity to the 2023 general elections.\n",
      "This was just as they urged the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari(retd.) to sign the proposed amendments to the Electoral Act into law to improve the quality of the 2023 elections\n",

      "These were contained in a communiqué issued at the end of a meeting convened by the Northern Elders’ Forum led by Prof Ango Abdullahi, at the Arewa House, Kaduna, on Saturday.\n",
      "They urged the northerners to vote for the best leaders while calling on them to ignore groups in “the South of Nigeria who appear to believe that command democracy in which threats and hate campaigns are their hallmarks or defining elements will work in Nigeria.”\n",
      "They, however, urged key northern groups to engage their counterparts from the South to improve understanding, lower tensions and contribute to the creation of an atmosphere that allows all Nigerians to live in peace with each other.\n",
      "The communiqué signed by the drafting committee chairman, Prof D. Sheni, partly read, “The fundamental rights of all political parties to field candidates of their choices, and the right of voters to freely exercise choices over who leads them cannot be compromised. Northerners have equal rights to aspire to all offices but they must raise competence, evidence of personal integrity and commitments to the rule of law above all other considerations.\n",
      "“While commending the efforts of the nation’s defence and security forces in rolling back sundry threats that have weakened the Nigerian State and made life almost valueless, the meeting advises the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari, governors and legislators to revisit and re-prioritize spending on security and addressing the scourge of poverty.\n",
      "North must vote competent Nigerian president in 2023 – NEF\n",
      "But the Northern Elders’ Forum on Saturday said the region would only vote for a competent candidate in the 2023 presidential election regardless of where he comes from in the country.\n",
      "It said it would not repeat the same mistake of voting for just any candidate as was done for the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.) based on sentiment in 2015.\n",

      "The NEF’s Director of Publicity and Advocacy, Dr Hakeem Baba-Ahmed, stated this in an interview with journalists on the sideline of the meeting of northern leaders of thought and groups held at the Arewa House, Kaduna on Saturday.\n",
      "Baba-Ahmed, however, noted that no northern presidential candidate should take the region for granted in the 2023 race, pointing out that the region had ended up with what he described as the “Buhari mistake”.\n",
      "He said the North was deceived into voting for Buhari believing that the country would be better, but lamented that the reverse had been the case as the situation in the North and the entire country had been worse than when Buhari took over in 2015.\n",
      "Baba-Ahmed, a former secretary of the Independent National Electoral Commission, said “A northerner and a southerner have equal rights to contest but northerners should be very careful of who they vote for in 2023. No northerner should take us for granted.\n",
      "“That’s how we ended up with President Buhari. We don’t want to repeat the same mistake. It’s not enough to be a northerner; you have to be the best. You have to be the best for the North and you have to be the best for the rest of Nigeria.”\n",
      "When asked further why Buhari was a mistake to the North, the spokesperson for the forum who scored the Buhari regime low in all aspects, said, “Why are you asking me why Buhari is a mistake? The evidence is all around you. How did you get here? I don’t know if you live in Kaduna or not but if you came from somewhere, you must have looked across your shoulders, maybe, more than 20 times because to leave your house and get back home is a miracle these days in this country. We were not like this.\n",
      "“This is not the Nigeria that voted for President Buhari. So, he is a disappointment. And that’s why we are saying to Nigerians and particularly to northerners to be very careful and not repeat the same mistake.”\n",

      "Meanwhile, the spokesperson for the Coalition of Northern Groups, Abdul-Azeez Suleiman, has said the North would not let itself be blackmailed into ceding power to any region.\n",
      "Suleiman accused the Obasanjo-led presidency of formulating policies that badly affected the economy of the country as a result of the pressure from the South-West in 1999.\n",
      "He said, “Our position is that the North will never let itself be blackmailed or intimidated into ceding power. We made the same mistake in 1999 by giving in to pressure from the South-West and paid for it. Obasanjo was brought to power by the northern political might, yet he failed to justifiably deal with the nation’s diversities as was expected.\n",
      "“The North certainly has the sagacity to use its population and repeat what it did in 2015 with its permanent voter cards. It is pedestrian for those who call themselves regional leaders to continue to think along having a regional and not Nigerian president.”\n",
